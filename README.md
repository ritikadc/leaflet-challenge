Module 15 Challenge
I created the Earthquake visualization and gathered and plotted more data. I went to the Uses Geo JSON Feed website and chose a data set to visualize. I made a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude. I included the popups that provided additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker was clicked. I also created the legend that will provide context for my map data. I plotted a second dataset on my map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. I plotted the tectonic plates dataset on the map in addition to the earthquakes, there were other base maps to choose from also. I put each data into separate overlays that can be turned on and off. I added layer controls to my map.
